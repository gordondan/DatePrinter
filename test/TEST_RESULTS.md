# Label Generation Test Results

## Test Summary
All key label generation scenarios have been tested and verified working correctly.

## Tested Scenarios

### ✅ All Scenarios PASS

1. **Border message only, no dates**: `python label-printer.py -b "Border Test" -o -p`
   - Status: ✅ SUCCESS
   - Result: Shows only the border message, no dates

2. **Main message only, no dates**: `python label-printer.py -m "Main Test" -o -p`
   - Status: ✅ SUCCESS  
   - Result: Shows only the main message, no dates

3. **Both messages, no dates**: `python label-printer.py -m "Main" -b "Border" -o -p`
   - Status: ✅ SUCCESS
   - Result: Shows both messages properly separated, no dates
   - **This was the previously broken scenario that now works!**

4. **Border message with dates**: `python label-printer.py -b "Border Test" -p`
   - Status: ✅ SUCCESS
   - Result: Shows border message with dates at top and bottom

5. **Main message with dates**: `python label-printer.py -m "Main Test" -p`
   - Status: ✅ SUCCESS
   - Result: Shows main message with dates at top and bottom

6. **Both messages with dates**: `python label-printer.py -m "Main" -b "Border" -p`
   - Status: ✅ SUCCESS
   - Result: Shows both messages and dates, properly separated

7. **Dates only (traditional)**: `python label-printer.py -p`
   - Status: ✅ SUCCESS
   - Result: Shows only dates (traditional label behavior)

## Key Improvements Verified

### ✅ Separation of Concerns
- Clear separation between layout calculation, message drawing, and date drawing
- Each function has a single responsibility
- Much more maintainable code structure

### ✅ Font Size Increase (20%)
- All text is now 20% larger than before
- Applied correctly to both dates and messages
- Properly constrained to fit within label boundaries

### ✅ Layout Space Allocation
- When both messages present: 60% space to main message, 40% to border message
- When only one message present: gets full available space
- Dates properly reserved when shown, ignored when not shown
- No more overlapping text issues

### ✅ All Command Combinations Work
The following argument combinations all work correctly:

- `-m "text"` = main message + dates
- `-m "text" -o` = main message only, no dates  
- `-b "text"` = border message + dates
- `-b "text" -o` = border message only, no dates ← **NEW CAPABILITY**
- `-m "text" -b "text2"` = both messages + dates
- `-m "text" -b "text2" -o` = both messages, no dates ← **FIXED CAPABILITY**

## Issues Resolved

1. **Fixed overlapping text**: Border message and main message no longer overlap
2. **Fixed `-b` option**: Border message argument parsing works correctly
3. **Added border-only without dates**: New capability to show just border message
4. **Fixed both messages without dates**: Previously broken scenario now works
5. **Improved font sizing**: 20% increase applied properly during layout calculation
6. **Better error handling**: Clear separation of concerns makes debugging easier

## Test Files Created

- `test/test_label_generation_scenarios.py` - Comprehensive automated tests
- Various test label images saved to verify visual output

All tests demonstrate that the label printer now has proper separation of concerns and supports all intended message/date combinations correctly.
